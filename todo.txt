1.  Some sort of web scraping to find and record book genres - we can try doing api calls if possible

2.  Match each reviewer to a specific age range - we can use clustering to find out how many and what age groups of people there are
    To do this: use dissimilarity matrix (Week 5) and locate where are the hotspots and group accordingly - find k number of clusters
    With this data of what type of consumers and reviewers there are we can extrapolate the data and analyse what this may mean in terms
    of skewing genres

4.  With this, we should be able to generate a pi chart of what each age group of people like to read

5.  We should at some point deal with outliers or corrupted data which will impact our results - examples could be:
    - rating not in correct number rante
    - book name not existing
    - book belonging to multiple genres at once

6.  If we are adventurous, we can possibly think about what aesthetic or topic each book covers and look at what hot topics are for reader 
    age groups. We can probably grab this or do some sort of ai search/query on the book.
